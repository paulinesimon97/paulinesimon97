- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pauline Simon (@paulinesimon97). 

- I'm currently doing a PhD in physics about turbulence in astrophysical plasmas at the Laboratory of Plasma Physics (LPP), in France. 
It consists on 3 axes : theory, simulation and observation. 
In the simulation and observationnal axes, I compute my theoretical results in data from turbulent plasma simulation and in-situ Solar Wind missions like MMS, PSP...
To do that, I use Python with class and MPI paradigms and display my results in Jupyter notebook with matplotlib. 

- If you are interested by my research subject and what I'm doing, don't hesitate to contact me at pauline.simon@lpp.polytechnique.fr and look at what I've published.
