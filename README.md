ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pauline Simon (@paulinesimon97). 

I'm currently doing a PostDoc at Queen Mary University of London about Turbulence and Space Weather.
I have a PhD in physics about turbulence in astrophysical plasmas, done at the Laboratory of Plasma Physics (LPP), in France. 

If you are interested by my research subject and what I'm doing, don't hesitate to contact me at pauline.simon@qmul.ac.uk and/or look at what I've published (more informations in repositories named '..._Article_...').
